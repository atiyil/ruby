# Devise a function that takes an input 'n' (integer) and returns a string that is the
# decimal representation of the number grouped by commas after every 3 digits. Do not 
# solve the task using a built-in formatting function that can accomplish the whole 
# task on its own. 

# Assume: 0 <= n < 1000000000 

# 1 -> "1" 
# 10 -> "10" 
# 100 -> "100" 
# 1000 -> "1,000" 
# 10000 -> "10,000" 
# 100000 -> "100,000" 
# 1000000 -> "1,000,000" 
# 35235235 -> "35,235,235" 
# 999999999 -> â€œ999,999,999"
